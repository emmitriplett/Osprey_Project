BBL2022_Req_828_enc_3640_20230209_120001 (2).csv, an r script file containing 
the project code, an .Rproj, a figs folder containing all figures, and a supplementary materials folder with the original data request from the Bird Banding Laboratory. 

The primary data set BBL2022_Req_828_enc_3640_20230209_120001 (2).csv includes birds encountered (and their banding event) from 1962-2022. Birds are in rows with information about when they were banded, how they were obtained, etc. in the columns. This data is in a .csv format.
birds-metadata.csv
site = ..... etc.

To recreate my results, request the data set from the Bird Banding Laboratory portal. Select Osprey as the species banded in the United States, encounters through North and South America  with banding event, years 1962-2022. Then follow the code written in the .R file and adjust the file path to the name of your data request. 

I would like to acknowledge Professor Roumillat and Professor McGlinn for their help on this project.
