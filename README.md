An Exploratory Analysis of Osprey Mortality

The purpose of this project is to explore Osprey banding and recovery data from 
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) database, using 
encounters data that are linked to banding events. The dataset covers a period 
of 62 years from 1960-2022 for Osprey banded within the United States. This 
study is an emulation of De Pascalis et al.’s European study, “Shift in 
proximate causes of mortality for six large migratory raptors over a century”, 
in which mortality is calculated as the probability of encountering a bird as 
either dead or alive. 

Folders and Files within this project repository:
‘Data’: the dataset retrieved from the USGS BBL and used for all analyses.
‘Scripts’: all codes used for data cleaning, analysis, and mapping.
‘Figures’: the figures and maps generated for this project.

To recreate my results, run the ‘osprey’ code located in the scripts folder for 
data subsetting and analysis related to causes and trends in mortality, and run 
‘mappingbirds’ to plot encounters data.

Required Packages: 

I would like to acknowledge Professor Roumillat and Professor McGlinn for their 
help on this project.
